# Next.js Project Setup and Basics

## Introduction

Welcome to the **alx-project-0x02-setup** repository.

This repository contains the foundational setup and structure for a Next.js project.
It covers the initial configuration steps such as setting up TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind CSS, and understanding the basics of how a Next.js app is structured.

The goal is to provide a clean and well-documented starting point for building scalable and maintainable web applications using the Next.js framework.
